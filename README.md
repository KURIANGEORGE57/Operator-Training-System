# Operator Training System

This repository contains a prototype Streamlit interface for experimenting with
operator training scenarios.  The application is intentionally lightweight so
new components can be added incrementally.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies (for example with `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
2. Launch the Streamlit user interface:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

The Streamlit app exposes manipulated variable controls, fault toggles, and
simple scoring feedback to give future contributors a clear starting point for
additional features.
